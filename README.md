# 2D MAP

This repository is for a simple map program. The map is a 2D array of characters. The map is initialized with a certain number of `-` symbols. The map is then populated with `X` symbol in a certain point with specified coordinates. The map is then printed to the specified file.

The program is written in a programming language Python. The reader is expected to be familiar with the programming language and evan can feel free to open an issue if he/she has any questions.

It would be great to see many PRs with different solutions in a variety of other languages as well.

P.S. there are no checks and the program is not guaranteed to work if the inputs are not correct. Maybe you can help me to improve the program via PRs?
